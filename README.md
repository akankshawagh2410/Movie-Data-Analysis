# Movie-Data-Analysis

I Analyzed the following Features:
1. Budget Analysis
2. Revenue Analysis
3. Voting Analysis
4. Director Analysis

Steps I used to Analyze the data:
1. Established a connection to the sqlite database by creating a connection
2. Created a cursor using the cursor() method.
3. Executed the query -> cursor_object.execute('query')
4. Fetch the data, then use fetchall() method for the cursor object.
